# Week4Assignement
Peer reviewed assignement on Getting and Cleaning data

This repository includes:
- Rscript (Run_analysis.R) used to clean and create the datasets
- A first file (tidy_data.txt) containing the raw dataset created using above mentionned script
- Codebook tidy_data.md the codebook for above-mentionned raw dataset
- A second file (tidy_data_average.txt) containing a second dataset, with average data, created using above mentionned script
- Codebook tidy_data_average.md, codebook for above-mention average dataset


The Run_analysis scripts does the following:
- ### 1. Import, read and merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
- ### 2. Extracts only the features corresponding to mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- ### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- ### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names 
- ### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Results are exported in tidy_data_average.txt
